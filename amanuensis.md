## Inspiration 💡

The modern electronic health record (EHR) encompasses a treasure trove of information across patient demographics, medical history, clinical data, and other health system interactions (Jensen *et al.*). Although the EHR represents a valuable resource to track clinical care and retrospectively evaluate clinical decision-making, the data deluge of the EHR often obfuscates key pieces of information necessary for the physician to make an accurate diagnosis and devise an effective treatment plan (Noori and Magdamo *et al.*). Physicians may struggle to synthesize the lengthy medical histories of their patients; in the absence of data-driven strategies to extract relevant insights from the EHR, they are forced to rely on intuition alone to generate questions for their patients.

The volume and complexity of the EHR can lead to missed opportunities for physicians to gather critical information pertinent to patient health, leading to medical errors or poor health outcomes. It is imperative to design tools and services to reduce the burden of manual EHR search on physicians and help them elicit the most relevant information from their patients.
